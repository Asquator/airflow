class PessimisticTaskSelector(TaskSelectorStrategy):
    """
    Pessimisticly query task instances ready for scheduling.

    Works by delegating almost all the work from python do sql.
    Uses a few nested window functions to query only ready tasks.

    The query is built in a dynamic manner, meaning, it can be extended easily
    but it might be hard to understand how everything connects.

    Each window checks a single concurrency limit (i.e parallelism, dag max active tasks, for more info visit https://stackoverflow.com/questions/56370720/how-to-control-the-parallelism-or-concurrency-of-an-airflow-installation)

    as of now, there exist 4 windows that check `mapped_tis_per_task_run_count` which checks for mapped
    tasks, `total_tis_per_dagrun_count` which checks for tis across all dagruns, `tis_per_dag_count` which
    check for specific task across all dagruns and `pool_slots_taken` which checks for pool slots taken by all
    tasks we want to set to queued.

    For each window, we have a value whome reflects the current state of the limit.
    These are called `concurrency map`, the name is taken from optimistic implementation.

    These include:

        `running_total_tis_per_dagrun`: counts all running tis per dagrun for the `total_tis_per_dagrun_count` window.

        `running_tis_per_dag`: counts all specific ti's across a dag (across all dagruns) for the `tis_per_dag_count` window.

        `running_total_tis_per_task_run`: counts all mapped tasks of specific task run for the `mapped_tis_per_task_run_count` window.

        `running_tis_per_pool`: which counts how many tasks are running per pool for the `pool_slots_taken` window.

    All of these are created using the `running_tasks_group` and are called the `Concurrency Map` function which just counts and groups tasks by the fields we give it, along with having some predicates to only count running tasks.

            Create a query with an added window limit from the LimitWindowDescriptor.

            This function uses the old query and the results from the old query (the query field)
            to join on the new window created dynamically (in order to use the tasks queried from the old query),
            and it is used to filter more and more tasks each window we create.
            It allows for additional outer join predicates in case they are needed.

            Priority Behaviour:
                The behaviour of priorities using this task selector is that we always drop less prioritized tasks,
                as long as they are related (meaning either same pool, same dag, dagrun or task (for mapped)).
                if the tasks are not related, we can have a lower priority task running before a higher priority one.
                Related tasks are tasks which have any common trait (i.e same pool), meaning,
                they can cause another related task to not run because they occupy some slot in the concurrency map of the same task.
                Otherwise, we can run lower priority tasks as they do not relate in any way and cannot interfere with a higher priority task running.
